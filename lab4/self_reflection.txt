All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Used two pointers to record the locations of the deque rather than one.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Used the circular form of the array.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The first edition's resize function.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Nope.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I haven't got that.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Design before coding.
